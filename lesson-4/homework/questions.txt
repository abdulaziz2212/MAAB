1.What is the difference between the continue and break statements in Python?
Answer: The continue statement will just skip the current iteration and will run next iteration, but the break statement will exit the entire loop regardless.

2. Can you explain the difference between for loop and while loop?
Answer: The for loop iterates through the sequence but while loop will iterates until the specified condition is true
3. How would you implement a nested for loop system? Provide an example
Answer: Simple way is one loop is inside another:
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n);
                pass
        Or we may use list comprohension:
        something=[j for i in range(n) for j in range(n)]
